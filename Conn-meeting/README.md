# Presentation to BioFinder group at Lund University

This presentation is made using Julia and the Pluto notebnook environment. If you wish to run the notebook, you will to follow these steps: 
* Make sure Julia is installed: https://julialang.org/downloads/
* Start a Julia REPL and enter Pkg mode (hit `]`) and add Pluto: `add Pluto`. 
* Hit backspace to return to the Julia REPL and run `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`
* A new browser window should open with the Pluto homescreen. Open `Presentation.jl`. 
* Pluto will install all of the dependencies and run most of the notebook. 
Unfortunately, there are some parts of the notebook that will not run because they require local data files, however, most assets are here in the presentation repo and should load just fine. 

If you do not want to run the notebook, there is also a static .html file that can be opened in a browser.
